# C3 GLFW

> Note: This is a toy project for me to learn C interop in C3. Don't expect this to be a full-featured GLFW binding.

- I only tested this on Windows, it should work on all major platforms, but some libraries required by OpenGL need to be specified in the manifest.
- Place the `glfw3.lib` from [the official binary release](https://www.glfw.org/download) in the windows-x64 folder.
